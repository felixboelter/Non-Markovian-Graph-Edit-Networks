# Non-markovian Graph Edit Networks

This repository focuses on Non-markovian Graph Edit Networks. In more detail, we attempt to extend the Graph Edit Networks proposed by Paassen et al. by the methods that have been proposed by Pareja et al. to account for non-Markovian systems. For further details on the methodology and the results see the report [here](https://github.com/jatlantic/GNN/blob/main/Non-Markovian%20GEN.pdf).

## Datasets

We used two different temporal network datasets to test the graph edit networks in a non-markovian setting:

1. The first dataset where the non-markovian graph edit network approach was tested on is the High-energy physics theory citation network which can be found [here](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/cit-HepTh.html).
2. The second dataset we used is called CollegeMsg temporal network and refers to private messages sent online in a college context. The data can be found [here](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/CollegeMsg.html).


## Getting Started

All information to run the code yourself is contained in the `HEP_CollegeMSG_Testing.ipynb` and `graph_dynamical_systems.ipynb` files where each cell can be run from top to bottom.
